# HI-TOYZ Front-End Website
Hello everyone! <br>
This is my final project for completing the Human and Computer Interaction course where I was tasked to design and code a website interface for a toy store. It is important to know that this website is a front-end website, which means it provides the overall website appearance (UI and UX) but does not contain any databases or servers. By sharing this, I hope you can find some insights or useful information. <br>
Thank you.
